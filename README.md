# My Site

This is where the code for my site is.

Context for how to work with this project (which I will probably be doing pretty often) is here: https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog

## Work work work

1. `git clone` the repository.
2. `yarn` from the root of the repo.
3. `gatsby develop` to run the site.

That's it, for now.
